# Longitudinal EHR Biostatistics Portfolio (R + SAS)

## Purpose
This repository documents my biostatistics portfolio focused on large-scale longitudinal observational data similar to EHR-derived datasets (labs, pharmacy, and patient-reported outcomes).

## Tools
- R
- SAS
- SQL (as needed)

## Workflow
1. Import and clean longitudinal datasets
2. Perform data quality control and validation checks
3. Create analytic datasets and codebooks (data dictionaries)
4. Draft statistical analysis plans (SAPs)
5. Produce publication-ready tables, listings, and figures (TLFs)

## Status
Portfolio in progress. Weekly updates and outputs will be added throughout 2026.
